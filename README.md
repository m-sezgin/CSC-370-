# Computer Vision Final Project: GOTURN Implementation

## Abstract

Object tracking is an important and relevant computer vision task that has a variety of applications in sports, security, autonomous driving, etc. GOTURN is a fast single object tracking algorithm developed in 2018 that is capable of tracking at up to 100 frames per second (FPS) with certain computer architectures. This paper focuses on training an instance of @nrupatunga's 2020 [GOTURN implementation](https://github.com/nrupatunga/goturn-pytorch) with limited training data in Google Colaboratory. Colabâ€™s runtime and GPU constraints did not allow for significant results to be produced within the timeframe of the project. Future work will focus on further analysis of this implementation, and analysis of GOTURN variants with different convolutional layer structures and training data.
